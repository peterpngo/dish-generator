# dish-generator
an application to generate dishes of randomized components - for interesting, unique dish inspiration

I first launched this as a website application you can see at https://www.dishgenerator.com (code written by Daniel Fearn)


The purpose is to provide you with randomly generated dishes made up by components in the categories of:
Protein, Vegetable, Starch, Sauce, and a Garnish/Accent

The intent is to challenge the creativity and flavor combination network that many cooks/chefs can get 
pidgeon-holed into. It's to give the opportunity to imagine dishes that wouldn't traditionally be thought of
or found in any book.

The ingredients vary in culture and seasonality. There are no prompts for cooking techniques to be used.


This is my first solo Python project.

Happy Dish Generating!
